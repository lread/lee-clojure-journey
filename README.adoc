= Lee's Clojure Journey

Just enjoying https://about.draw.io/[draw.io] and recording my
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lread/lee-clojure-journey@1a8237c32476785398f29931099838feeb43464d/lee-clojure-journey.svg[Clojure journey].

== Notes to self

* Includes link:export-to-svg.clj[a little script to convert drawio to svg and hoverize links] to run it:
+
[source,shell]
----
clojure export-to-svg.clj
----
Assumes draw.io desktop app is installed.

* To create a new release, run `release` - it takes care of updating links within this document.

* Am using jsdelivr to allow sharing svg with proper rendering. I found that a raw
github url with `sanitize=true` did not do the trick. Some elements were not
drawn.

* The above Clojure journey link matches current github version, here's
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lread/lee-clojure-journey@latest/lee-clojure-journey.svg[the
latest available]. Note: it seems like jsdelivr caches for 7 days, so if you really
want to be sure you are viewing latest, head to HEAD and hit Clojure journey
link at the top of this doc.
